# Convolutional Neural Networks based Sign Language Recognition


ABSTRACT: A communication problem has always existed between the deaf community and the hearing majority.
Recent innovations in the fields of computer vision wherein automatic sign language recognition tools have been
developed has helped overcome this problem. The system proposed in this paper uses the power of Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) to recognize the hand gestures fed in through camera and predict the alphabet associated with
the particular hand sign in real-time. Our system uses the pre-trained Googleâ€™s Inception v3 model. We have used
transfer learning technique to modify pre-trained neural network to solve the problem. The proposed system
implements a predictive model built on a sparse data still giving cross validation accuracy of 100%. The system
achieves an overall of 91% accuracy in real-time recognition.
